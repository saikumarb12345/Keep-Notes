# Keep-Notes
Keep Notes is a simple note-taking app that I have created. The web application is written in **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

The web application is designed to be simple and easy to use. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. 

The app is still under development, but it is a great way to learn the basics of JavaScript.
**Features**
- The following features are included in this app:
  - Create, edit, and delete notes
  - Tag and organize notes into folders


**Getting Started**
- To get started with these projects, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:
- Code Snippet
 ```
 git clone git clone https://github.com/saikumarb12345/Keep-Notes.git
 ```
 - Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the projects in your favorite text editor(**Ex: VSCode...**).
